                  The periphery of large urban centers have long been the site for activities and uses that benefit from seclusion, namely industry and waste infrastructure as well as leisure and recreation. Jamaica bay is a site of all such uses. Its beaches and the islands have historically been used recreationally by New Yorkers, however it was not until after the bay was rejected as a location for the port of  New York in the early 20th Century that the islands and coastal area were was zoned and developed as parks. The prolific Robert Moses established the park in the 1940s in the same rezoning plan in which he put in the four wastewater treatment plants, placed New York City Public Housing Projects in the far rockaways, and artificially constructed two freshwater ponds on Broad Channel Island before naming the area the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge (It is technically not a Wildlife Refuge). In 1972 Jamaica Bay and its islands, along with areas in Sandy Hook and Staten Island, were inaugurated as the Gateway National Recreation Area in order to “preserve and protect scarce and/or unique natural, cultural, and recreational resources with relatively convenient access by a high percentage of the nation’s population.”

                  Over the last hundred years, large scale infrastructural developments in Jamaica Bay have drastically changed the shape and size of its coast and islands. Some of this change was designed, most was unintended. The shore of the bay, on the southern periphery of New York City, is host to familiar municipal infrastructures necessary for the maintenance of a contemporary American city— it is dotted with four wastewater treatment plants, three closed city landfills, and an international airport. The vast impermeable surfaces of the airport runways inevitably direct toxic storm water run-off into the bay. The landfills along the water's edge slowly leach toxins while the wastewater treatment plants release partially treated wastewater rich in nitrogen into the bay daily. The effects of these contaminants are then exacerbated by the warming of the water due to the global effects of climate change, to which these contribute. The warm nitrogen rich water erodes the islands and the coast.  Sea level rise is experienced bimonthly by the residents of Broad Channel Island, the only inhabited island in the bay, when tidal flooding submerges their streets. The residents of the Rockaways and of Broad Channel Island have faced destruction of property and mandatory evacuations for both hurricane Irene in 2011 and hurricane Sandy in 2012.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The large scale and accelerated erosion of the islands is currently being combated by the National Park Service who have since 2006, partnered with the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and local non-governmental organizations to reconstruct approximately 154 acres of salt marsh islands using the dredged material from maintenance and deepening operations of the shipping channels that access the New York and New Jersey Harbors.

                  The shipping channels in the New York Harbor need to maintain their depth because the deeper  a shipping barge can be submerged in the channel, the more cargo it can carry and the greater economic value the shipment will have. Constant maintenance of these channels are needed because sediment is not only regularly transported down the hudson river estuary due to natural river flows, but also up from the Atlantic Ocean with the dominant incoming sea swell and littoral drifts along the Long Island and New Jersey Coasts. The necessary logistics of maintaining the large scale commercial infrastructure of the ports thus enables the National Park Service in partnership with the USACE to reconstruct nature as a cultural and recreation resource.
                  Leachate and nitrogen rich wastewater from the municipal waste infrastructures unceasingly flow into the bay and  persistently erode the land while the waste material from the maintenance of the commercial maritime infrastructure aids to the reconstruction of it. These unintended byproducts and their effects of each municipal process do not negate the effects of each other, but rather serve as two outputs that demand a cyclical process of reconstruction of the ‘natural environment’ in which nature will continue to be redefined by the entities that are reconstructing them.

                  Jamaica Bay has the ideal features to serve as a field campus and site for the Army Corp of Engineers. The focus of the organization on the techno-bureaucratic management of land makes this site germane, due to its anthropocenic conditions, for a school and lab to study and test new climatic conditions, water compositions, and waste landforms. The area will remain a National Recreation Area, open to the public and residents are welcome to remain living within the bounds of the campus.

                  This center is the serves as the gate to the entire campus. It is located at the only inlet into Jamaica Bay. This building has multiple functions: it serves as a foot and bicycle bridge connecting two parks within the National recreation areas—Barren Island and Fort Tilden; It processes toxic sediment dredged from the Ambrose Channel, biosolids remnants from the wastewater treatment plants dotting the bay, and potentially recovered material from the fountain avenue and pennsylvania avenue landfills; lastly it acts as a flood gate at the inlet to Jamaica bay, which aids in managing the water level of the bay to perform controlled experiments within the entire bay as well as within the open area at the center of the circular building.
