                <h3>Repositioning The Court</h3>
                <p>Approximately 80% of the population of Rikers Island are detainees that have not been convicted of a crime and awaiting trial. Kalief Browder was a detainee on Rikers Island and his arrests and time spent incarcerated without a conviction exemplifies how the current system is broken. Kalief was arrested twice, about 8 months apart. The first time he was not detained after the night of his arrest and during his court appearance he was charged and plead guilty to a crime in which he was a bystander. He given probation as his sentence. The second time, Kalief was arrested a few days after the alleged crime and he maintained innocence in court. Since he was on probation at the time of the second arrest, he was given a high bail which he and his family could not pay. He was then taken to Rikers Island for detainment.</p>

                  People usually don’t stay in Rikers as long as him, because people plea out. In 2011 the Bronx Criminal Court only 165 people with felony charges went to trial, while nearly 4,000 pled guilty. Fewer felony defendants have been going to trial than they have historically. This is in large part to mandatory minumums and sentencing guidelines which give prosecution more power in the courts than judges, because the charges the prosecution files already have sentences attached to them. So, who are these people that are being detained currently? 89% of Rikers Island detainees are black or latino while only 53% of New York City residents are Black or Latino. Majority of person are too poor to pay bail, even if the amount is a couple hundred dollars. Race and poverty are linked. The poorer areas are the ones that have historically not received investment. The Redlining map of 1938 looks very similar to a 2010 annual per capita income map.

                  Urban environments in disinvested areas predispose arrest, and after arrest, the ones health and opportunities decrease. While one’s physical health might improve, their mental health is deteriorated. The arrested person has a mark on their record, which prevents them from education and career opportunities. We should understand that the moment of arrest, is the moment as which the failing of the system of governance is revealed, and an opportunity to engage with citizens who need the services that often have historically been denied to them.

                  Traditional misdemeanor and felony courts are located in all 5 boroughs. Newer community courts are more dispersed and cater to one or two precincts rather than an entire borough. There are many non-profits operating outside the court that are trying to provide alternatives to incarceration and to divert people considered “low risk” or have mental health or drug issues into services. However their services are usually engaged as part of a plea or sentencing. While community courts are ideal, there are few, and they come too late in the process to assist in diverting people. Mediation is now provided as an alternative to trials and as an alternative adjudication method, however there are inadequate spaces for this to take place. The most progressive diversion program is L.E.A.D which is fully functional in only 5 cities. This program depends on communication between social workers, police officer, prosecution, and community members to identify individuals whose crimes are a product of their own drug addiction or due to prostitution. This allows for early identification of potential arrestees who would benefit and pushes diverts them from the system completely. In the first 24 hours after arrest, an individual should be diverted into a procedure and program that helps them, rather than deferring the course until a later court date. The rigid system of the criminal justice system is designed with an equally rigid architectural logic.

                  Architecture in the court enforces roles for certain procedures through positioning of bodies within a space— the direction they face and the height at which they sit as well as whether they are stationary or itinerant positions. Within the temporal space of a trial, persons inhabit the same space with the same roles over days, months, or years. The repetitive inscription of the roles into the space reaffirms the legitimacy and normalcy of the procedure. The dense and heavy furniture of the courtroom, standardized within the Standard Level Features and Finished for US Courts Facilities by the US General Services Administration, naturalizes the intractability of the procedure and the inflexibility of the process. The architectural logics that support traditional power dynamics within a courtroom can be redeployed, to negate the traditional hierarchy of the existing system. Reorienting the heights of the roles, their furniture, and their positions relative to each other while including existing roles that currently happen outside of the arraignment process can provide space for other outcomes than pleas deals or years of detainment.
