              <p>Jamaica Bay’s coast and islands have drastically changed in size and shape over the last hundred years due to intended and unintended effects of large scale infrastructural development.
              Most of the intentional reshaping of the area was done in order to accommodate large infrastructural nodes essential to the growth and functioning of the city. For example, JFK airport, which opened as idlewild airport in 1948, was constructed on soil dredged from the bay, while Canarsie Pol Island was created from the waste dredged material from shipping channels carved into the coast of Brooklyn.</p>
